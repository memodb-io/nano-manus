## Features

- **Small**: `nano_manus` is about 1000 LOC.
- **Using MCP**: `nano_manus` supports [loading MCP](./examples/load_mcp_tools.py) from [docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp), `npx` and [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/)
- **Plan-then-Execute**: `nano_manus` will gather your agents, make the plans and then assign the correct jobs to your agents



## Use Cases

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33b90afc-2e30-4ab0-8988-bd7d6da065fb


- `Find all .py file and explain them to me `
- `Give me the latest weather in SF in last 7 days and save it to csv`

> Welcome to give more use cases!



## QuickStart

#### Setup

- Install [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

#### Env

- [Brave Search API key](https://brave.com/search/api/)
- [Jina API key](https://jina.ai/)
- OpenAI API key

Your `.env` should look like:

```
BRAVE_API_KEY=BSAxxxx

## Known Issues

- `nano-manus` is extremely unstable! My guess is `gpt-4o` is not that good at tool use.
- `Unable to exit`: seem like some MCPs will cause the problems of unable to exit the program when all the tasks were done.
- `nano-manus` will operate files and run command **on the current dir of your local computer**, make sure you don't run it on some important folders.
